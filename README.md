A python program to develope below hypothesis test on given data set

# Session data
From server logs, you can access the raw session data, that contains information about single
visits to our website (= sessions). A click out is logged whenever a user clicks on a hotel and is
redirected to the booking page. The booking field is binary and indicates if a hotel booking was
logged after one of the click outs. Have a look at the data and check if there is any connection
between the booking data and other given information. Feel free to formulate hypothesis based
on your findings.
